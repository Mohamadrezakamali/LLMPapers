# Large Language Models Papers

![](resources/image1.gif)

ðŸ”¥ Welcome to our dedicated GitHub repository, where we aim to share the most impactful papers and resources in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As students deeply engrossed in the AI domain, our mission is to assemble a collection of pivotal and recent publications that are steering the future of this expansive field. We intend to explore a variety of areas within AI, starting with the game-changing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which have transcended traditional language understanding to enable new forms of knowledge generation and reasoning.

Our repository not only emphasizes the advancements in LLMs but also delves into critical aspects such as explainability, privacy, security, and recommender systems. Explainability is key to making AI systems more interpretable and trustworthy, while privacy and security remain paramount in safeguarding data integrity. Recommender systems, a prime application of AI, illustrate the technology's vast influence on consumer behavior and societal trends. Through sharing selected papers, talks, tutorials, courses, and books, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone keen on grasping the current and future trajectories of AI, fostering a community that contributes to the field's growth and understanding.
